## Instruction: 

* Step 0: clipImage.py and clip_brighten.py are 2 files to modify original hand written images such that the output images need to be B&W with black screen and white mark.
* Step 1: ./data_processing contains files to process images and extract symbols
- run preprocess_images.py to shrink images to 28x28 and save to its current position
- run extract_symbol.py to get train and test data
* Step 2: ./data_training contains files to train images
- train_model.py to train train data and create a checkpoint for the CNN deep learning model
- validate_test_data.py to validate the model on test data created
* Step 3: ./data_prediction contains files to predict images
- predict.py to predict the images (processed)
